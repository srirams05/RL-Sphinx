Yes, that's correct! Here's a summary of the workflow:

When you make changes to any markdown file (e.g., chapter2.md), run:

.\update-docs.ps1 -MarkdownFile "chapter2.md" -CommitMessage "Updated chapter 2 content"



The script will:

Process LaTeX delimiters in your markdown
Rebuild Sphinx documentation
Copy the built files to docs directory
Commit and push changes to GitHub
Then:

Wait a few minutes for GitHub Pages to rebuild (usually 1-2 minutes)
Access your documentation at https://srirams05.github.io/RL-Sphinx/
Note:

You can provide any meaningful commit message
If you omit -CommitMessage, it defaults to "Update documentation"
GitHub Pages deployment status can be checked in your repository's "Actions" tab
So the entire process is automated with just one command!
